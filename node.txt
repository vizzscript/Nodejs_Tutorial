Node.js support a framework called as Express to define or create a Node.js application in a faster manner i.e. with 
minimum efforts a Node.js application.

It has to be installed using npm as it is not part of the standard installation, it allows us to route a Node.js application
using the routing techniques, allows us to define the middleware logic exclusively allows url-parsing, database connectivity
dynamic web-page creation with standard templates module pug.

In earlier programs we use http, created server and made it listen to the clients request, but using express this things 
can be handled by express whereas we can deal with the actual logic.

To create a node.js project we use the command "npm init" or specify the command "npm init -y" this setting creates the 
project with all the default options whereas in the first option we need to give the arguments for the settings once the 
project is created package.json contains the list of dependencies as we install modules the dependencies inside this files
are populated, to install express globally we use the command "npm install -g express" whereas to install it locally on the 
folder we use "npm install express".

To run a node project we use the option "node index.js" but if the contents of this file is changed we need to restart the 
server for changes to get reflected automatically we use the option "nodemon index.js" to execute the server program.
